# Hark Dashboard Protocol v1 (`hark.dashboard.v1`)

Normative contract between a hark backend and the dashboard webui.
The Python `hark webui` (aliases: `dashboard`, `serve`) implements it today; the Rust port MUST implement the
same endpoints, pass the same fixtures (`fixtures/dashboard/`), and serve the
same webui bundle unmodified. Design rationale: [plans/I003-dashboard.md](plans/I003-dashboard.md).

Schemas: `schemas/dashboard-v1/` · Fixtures: `fixtures/dashboard/` ·
Related: [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) (HEP) · [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md)

## Quickstart

```bash
hark webui                     # http://127.0.0.1:4136 — no auth on localhost
hark webui --port 5000
hark doctor                    # includes a `dashboard:` posture line
```

Everything workers write (watch, ambient, syslog, usage, deliveries) streams
live; arm workers with `./scripts/run-mode-a.sh` and the feed lights up.
Dictate (◉) captures via the browser mic (needs HTTPS or localhost; server
needs `ffmpeg`) or the host mic (existing listen flow), then submits only
after review — as a bound answer to a pending event or as an operator prompt.

**Phone / remote (tailnet):** set a token, terminate TLS, then open the
`https://…ts.net` URL:

```bash
hark serve --print-token       # → [dashboard].token in config.toml
tailscale serve 4136           # TLS on your *.ts.net name
# config.toml: [dashboard] host = "127.0.0.1"; tls_terminated = true
```

PWA install, notifications, and phone-mic capture are secure-context APIs —
they do not work over plain `http://100.x.y.z` (see Security below).

Webui development: `cd webui && npm run dev` (proxies `/api` to a local
`hark serve`) or `npm run dev:fixtures` (replays the golden contract fixtures,
no backend). Ship it with `scripts/build-webui.sh` (staged into the wheel). **After building, restart `hark webui`** — a browser refresh alone does not reload a process that started when the bundle was missing (fixed to re-scan, but restart is still the reliable path).

## Transport

- **REST + SSE** over HTTP/1.1. All payloads are JSON (UTF-8).
- The live stream is a single **SSE** endpoint (`GET /api/v1/stream`). Messages
  are transport-agnostic JSON objects — a future WebSocket endpoint (Rust port)
  MUST carry byte-identical message objects, one per text frame.
- Clients open **one stream per tab** (browsers cap HTTP/1.1 connections/host
  at ~6); panels share it.
- SSE keepalive: servers SHOULD emit a comment line (`: ping`) at least every
  30 s of silence.

## Stream envelope

Every SSE `data:` line is one envelope (`stream.schema.json`):

```json
{
  "schema": "hark.dashboard.v1",
  "type": "event",
  "source": "watch",
  "cursor": "watch:184,ambient:42,system:9051,usage:77,delivery:12",
  "payload": { "schema": "hark.event.v1", "kind": "agent.blocked", "…": "…" }
}
```

- `type`: `hello` (first message on connect) | `event`.
- `source`: `watch` | `ambient` | `system` | `usage` | `delivery` | `serve`.
- `payload` is **source-shaped** (discriminated union, see below). Consumers
  MUST ignore unknown fields and unknown `source`/`kind` values.
- `cursor` is the **composite cursor**: the full per-source position *after*
  this event, joined by commas. It is also set as the SSE
  `id:` field, so `Last-Event-ID` on reconnect restores every source, not just
  the one that happened to emit last.

### Cursor semantics

- `seq` is the 1-based record index within the current incarnation of the
  backing source (line number for JSONL-backed sources). Monotonic per source
  while the backing file is not rotated.
- Cursors are **opaque to clients** beyond equality/passthrough. Clients MUST
  NOT construct cursors except from `hello`, event envelopes, or page results.
- Servers accept legacy `key:seq` positions and emit proved positions as
  `key:seq@incarnation~checkpoint[~byte_offset]`. The proof fields are opaque
  lowercase hexadecimal values; the optional offset is unsigned decimal. Keys
  match `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*` and are unique. Invalid cursor input is rejected
  with `400 bad_cursor` before any SSE frame is emitted.
- The checkpoint proves the complete raw-line prefix through `seq`. It permits
  bounded forward pagination when the source is unchanged. If the file was
  rotated or acknowledged bytes were rewritten, the server safely replays the
  new incarnation from its first record instead of seeking to the old offset.

### `hello`

First message on every stream connect:

```json
{
  "schema": "hark.dashboard.v1",
  "type": "hello",
  "source": "serve",
  "cursor": "watch:184,ambient:42,system:9051,usage:77,delivery:12",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "serve.hello",
    "server": "hark-serve-py",
    "version": "0.1.6",
    "sources": ["watch", "ambient", "system", "usage", "delivery", "serve"]
  }
}
```

On a resumed stream, `hello.cursor` MUST repeat the requested cursor (from
`Last-Event-ID` or `since`) because the handshake has not delivered any replay
record yet.  On a fresh live-only stream it establishes the server's current
cursor as the starting baseline.  Clients MUST NOT adopt a hello cursor as a
new event acknowledgement.

### Payloads by source

| source | payload shape | backing |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `watch`, `ambient` | HEP `hark.event.v1` object, passed through unchanged | `watch.jsonl`, `ambient.jsonl` |
| `system` | LogEvent: `ts` (float s), `seq`, `level` (`debug\|info\|warn\|error`), `component`, `event`, `message`, `data{}`, `pid` | `system.jsonl` |
| `usage` | UsageEvent: `kind` (`tts\|stt`), `ts`, `provider?`, `voice?`, `ok`, `chars`, `words`, `audio_ms`, `latency_ms`, `error?`, `meta{}` | `usage.jsonl` |
| `delivery` | `{type:"bound", …BoundEvent}` or `{type:"outcome", event_id, status, ts, …}` | `events.jsonl`, `deliveries.jsonl` |
| `serve` | `{kind:"serve.*", …}` server meta: hello, dictation state, live spectrum, degradations | in-process |

Note: HEP payloads are validated structurally (envelope + required HEP core
fields), **not** against `event-v1.schema.json`'s closed kind enum —
`ambient.*`/`announce.*` kinds are intentionally absent there. Unknown kinds
MUST flow through.

## Authentication

Two modes, decided by bind address + config:

- **Localhost bind (default `127.0.0.1`)**: no auth required (configurable
  `require_token = true` to force it).
- **Non-localhost bind**: server MUST refuse to start without a configured
  token, and every `/api/*` request except `POST /api/v1/auth` MUST be
  authenticated.

Flow (`EventSource` cannot set headers, so header-only auth is out):

1. `POST /api/v1/auth` `{"token": "…"}` → `200 {"ok": true}` +
   `Set-Cookie: hark_dash=<session>; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/`
   (+ `Secure` when serving TLS or behind `tls_terminated = true`).
2. All subsequent requests (including the SSE stream) authenticate via the
   cookie. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` is ALSO accepted everywhere (for
   non-browser clients).
3. Unauthenticated → `401 {"ok": false, "error": {"code": "unauthorized"}}`.

Tokens never appear in URLs. Remote (e.g. tailnet) use additionally requires
TLS for browser secure-context APIs — see [DASHBOARD_SECURITY](#security).

## Endpoints

All responses are JSON. Errors use
`{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "<slug>", "message": "…"}}` with an
appropriate HTTP status (`error.schema` in `actions.schema.json`).

| Method + path | Purpose | Schema |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/auth` | token → session cookie | `actions.schema.json#authRequest/authResponse` |
| `GET  /api/v1/health` | server + doctor summary | `health.schema.json` |
| `GET  /api/v1/config` | redacted config snapshot | `config.schema.json` |
| `GET  /api/v1/events?since=<cursor>&sources=a,b&limit=N` | backfill page | `events-page.schema.json` |
| `GET  /api/v1/stream?sources=a,b&replay=N` | SSE live stream | `stream.schema.json` per `data:` line |
| `GET  /api/v1/herdr/sessions` | sessions/panes/status map | `herdr-sessions.schema.json` |
| `GET  /api/v1/herdr/context/<session>/<pane>?lines=N` | recent pane context | `context.schema.json` |
| `GET  /api/v1/deliveries` | pending queue + recent outcomes | `deliveries.schema.json` |
| `GET  /api/v1/usage` | usage summary + near-miss groups | `usage.schema.json` |
| `POST /api/v1/answer` | bound answer to a HEP event | `actions.schema.json#answerRequest/answerResponse` |
| `POST /api/v1/prompt` | inject ambient operator prompt | `actions.schema.json#promptRequest/promptResponse` |
| `POST /api/v1/dictation/transcribe` | one-shot browser-audio STT | `actions.schema.json#transcribeResponse` |
| `POST /api/v1/dictation/start\|stop\|cancel` | host-mic capture control | `actions.schema.json#dictation*` |
| `GET  /` + static assets | the webui bundle (same-origin) | — |

### `GET /api/v1/events`

- `since`: composite (or single-source) cursor; omitted → recent tail.
- `sources`: comma filter (default: all).
- `limit`: max events (server clamps; default 500).
- Response: `{ok, events: [envelope…], cursor: "<composite after last>",
  complete: <bool — false if more available before now>}`.
- With `since`, pages move forward from the cursor: when `complete` is false,
  the response contains the earliest `limit` unseen events and its cursor is
  after only those returned events.  Clients can pass it to the next request
  without skipping omitted records.
- Without `since`, the endpoint is a recent-tail snapshot.  Records older than
  the configured history/limit window are intentionally outside that snapshot;
  the page cursor establishes the current high-water mark for the live stream.

### `POST /api/v1/answer` — safe delivery (normative)

The dashboard is a **delivery owner UI**, so the HEP safety invariants apply
verbatim ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)): the browser MUST NOT invent
target IDs — `event_id` MUST come from a received event, and the server binds
delivery to that event's recorded target.

```json
{ "event_id": "01J…", "text": "No, keep the build directory.", "keys": null }
```

- Exactly one of `text` | `keys` (list of key names, e.g. `["2","enter"]`).
- Server resolves the event via the DeliveryStore, **registering on demand**
  from the tailed HEP record when not already registered.
- Server MUST re-validate pane revision + question fingerprint before sending
  (same checks as `hark answer`) and MUST record the outcome idempotently.
- Response `status`: `delivered` | `rejected` (stale/unknown/policy) |
  `uncertain` (write may have landed). Rejections include `error.code`
  `stale_target` | `unknown_event` | `already_delivered` | `bad_request`.

### `POST /api/v1/prompt`

`{"text": "…", "session_id": null}` → appends a final `ambient.prompt` HEP
event to the ambient feed (same shape as a voice wake), so the orchestrator
orchestrator picks it up with its normal judgment. Response includes the new
`event_id`. This is the unbound path; routing stays with the orchestrator.

### Dictation

- **Browser capture** (stateless): record locally (MediaRecorder), then
  `POST /api/v1/dictation/transcribe` with the audio as the request body
  (`Content-Type: audio/webm`, `audio/mp4`, `audio/ogg`, or `audio/wav`).
  Server transcodes to WAV (ffmpeg) if needed, runs the configured STT
  provider, returns `{ok, text, provider, latency_ms}`. `501
  {"error":{"code":"transcode_unavailable"}}` when ffmpeg is missing and the
  body is not WAV.
- **Host capture**: `POST /api/v1/dictation/start {"mode":"host"}` drives the
  local `hark listen` flow (mic lease + ambient pause). Progress and the final
  transcript arrive on the stream as `serve.dictation` payloads
  (`state: recording|transcribing|done|failed|cancelled`, `text?`).
  `stop`/`cancel` control the capture. `409 {"error":{"code":"mic_busy"}}`
  when the mic lease is held.
- Submission of a transcript is a separate, explicit `/answer` or `/prompt`
  call after operator review. Dictation endpoints never deliver.

### Live voice spectrum (B087)

While the host mic is capturing (listen / ask / ambient / host dictation), the
capture path computes short-window FFT band magnitudes and publishes the
**latest frame only** to `spectrum.latest` under the state dir (no JSONL
history, no disk growth). `hark serve` coalesces that frame onto the existing
SSE stream as:

```json
{
  "schema": "hark.dashboard.v1",
  "type": "event",
  "source": "serve",
  "cursor": "<unchanged composite>",
  "payload": {
    "kind": "serve.spectrum",
    "bands": [0.0, 0.12, 0.4, "…"],
    "ts": 1710000000.123,
    "recording": true,
    "sample_rate": 16000,
    "max_hz": 6000,
    "source": "listen"
  }
}
```

- `recording: true` during STT-bound capture (listen / answer); ambient idle
  feed uses `recording: false` so the panel can stay live without looking hot.
- Spectrum frames **do not** advance the composite cursor and **must not** be
  appended to the events timeline (webui treats them as a dedicated signal).
- Target cadence is ~60 fps on the SSE loop (latest-frame coalesce; slow
  clients drop intermediate frames).
- Webui: collapsible spectrum strip under the topbar; auto-expands while
  `recording` unless the operator collapsed it during a recording period
  (preference in `localStorage`).

## Config (`[dashboard]` in `config.toml`)

```toml
[dashboard]
host = "127.0.0.1"     # non-localhost requires token
port = 4136
token = ""              # generate: hark serve --print-token
require_token = false   # force auth even on localhost
tls_terminated = false  # set true behind tailscale serve / reverse proxy (Secure cookies)
history_limit = 2000    # default backfill window per source
```

## Redaction (normative)

Responses MUST Not contain provider credentials or other secret material:

- No API keys, OAuth tokens, session tokens, or password-like values in any
  response body. Provider auth stays summarized as availability booleans +
  source labels (as `hark doctor` already reports).
- The dashboard token itself never appears in any response (only in the
  client→server direction of `/auth`).
- `fixtures/dashboard/config.json` is the golden redacted snapshot;
  `tests/test_dashboard_contract.py` walks every fixture and rejects
  secret-shaped strings (contract regression gate).

## Security

- Default bind `127.0.0.1`. Never expose to the public internet.
- Remote use is tailnet-scoped and **requires TLS** for browser secure-context
  APIs (PWA install, notifications, `getUserMedia`): use `tailscale serve`
  (recommended; terminates TLS on `*.ts.net`) or `tailscale cert` + a TLS
  terminator, with `tls_terminated = true`.
- No CORS headers: the webui is same-origin by construction. Non-browser
  clients use bearer auth.
- `hark doctor` flags: non-localhost bind without token (error);
  remote-looking bind without `tls_terminated` (warning).

## Versioning

- This document + `schemas/dashboard-v1/` are the v1 contract. Additive
  changes (new fields, new sources, new `serve.*` kinds, new endpoints) are
  allowed within v1; consumers MUST ignore what they don't know.
- Breaking changes require `hark.dashboard.v2` under a new schema dir and
  `/api/v2/` prefix.
